<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<br>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of global mortality and a major contributing cause of disability. Recently, there has been increased interest in the application of photoplethysmography (PPG) for arterial blood pressure (ABP) estimation. While several papers have been published on techniques for directly calculating blood pressure from hand-crafted PPG features, this requires extensive domain expertise which is not widely available. In contrast, the estimation of blood pressure using deep learning techniques presents itself as a viable alternative, given access to a high enough volume of quality data. Surprisingly, while several research groups have demonstrated the viability of blood pressure estimation using deep learning, there are few examples of such a model being implemented into a wearable consumer device. In this project, we train and deploy a deep learning model (Enceladus) based on a modified U-Net architecture to predict ABP waveforms from PPG waveforms. In addition, we build a wrist-worn PPG device (the Heartfelt Blood Pressure Monitor) that leverages the model and interfaces with a web application to display blood pressure over time and notify the user of sudden cardiac events.</p>
